# CONTROL SYSTEMS PLOTS

This repository features a collection of Python - based plots and scripts, demonstrating the core principles of Control Theory. Designed mostly for fellow students, in order to visualize some of the basic concepts of systems control.

These plots are based on the curriculum of the subject "Introduction to Automatic Control", taught during the fifth semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. 

New plots and scripts will regularly be added, to expand this collection. Stay tuned!
